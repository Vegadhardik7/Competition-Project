# Competition-Project (Anti-Suicide Project)

As suicide reate is rising in the world and people are getting more depressed, this project which will help to understand users mental state and show them ads based on it, this model is trained using LSTM and is 90% accurate. I belive using power of AI we can change the world in a better way... The modified version of this would be a chrome extension which will take user text as input and understand their mental state and if thier suicidal score goes beyond certain threshold... the near by any goverment agency will contact that person and help them to come out of them.
